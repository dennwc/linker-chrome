  `paper-autocomplete-suggestions`

  **From v3.x.x, this component only works with Polymer 1.7+ or 2.0+.**

  [![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/jhuesos.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/jhuesos)

  Allows to add autocomplete capabilities to any input field. This is desirable when you have an input field with custom
  logic and you just want to add the feature to help users with the selection. If you want to use it in combination with
  a regular `<paper-input>`, you can use `<paper-autocomplete>`.

  Example:
  ```
  <div class="autocomplete-wrapper">
    <paper-input id="myInput" label="Select State"></paper-input>

    <paper-autocomplete-suggestions
      for="myInput"
      source="[[accounts]]"></paper-autocomplete-suggestions>
  </div>
  ```

  It is **important to provide both `textProperty` and `valueProperty` when working with a custom search function and
  or custom templates.** They are needed to keep the component accessible and for the events (e.g. onSelect) to keep
  working.

  ### About Polymer 1.x and 2.x Compatibility
  From version `3.x.x`, this component work with both Polymer 1.7+ or Polymer 2.0+ Please take a look to the
  [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) file that contains more information.

  ### Custom search
  This component has the public method `queryFn` that is called in each key stroke and it is responsible to query
  all items in the `source` and returns only those items that matches certain filtering criteria. By default, this
  component search for items that start with the recent query (case insensitive).
  You can override this behavior providing your own query function, as long as these two requirements are fulfill:

  - The query function is synchronous.
  - The API is respected and the method always return an Array.


  The template use to render each suggestion depends on the structure of each object that this method returns. For the
  default template, each suggestion should follow this object structure:

  ```
    {
      text: objText,
      value: objValue
    }
  ```

  This function is only used when a local data source is used. When using a `remoteDataSource` user is responsible of
  doing the search and specify suggestions manually.

  ### Custom templates
  A template for each suggestion can be provided, but for now, there are limitations in the way you can customize
  the template. Please read the the following sections carefully.
  In order to set your own template, you need to add a `<template>` tag with the slot name
  `autocomplete-custom-template` and a structure equivalent to the one shown in the `<account-autocomplete>` component in
  the demo.

  You need to always maintain this structure. Then you can customize the content of paper-item. These are the reasons
  why you need to maintain it:

  - `onSelectHandler` it is very important because it will notify the `autocomplete` component when user selects one item.
  If you don't add this option, when user clicks in one of the items, nothing will happen.
  - `id`, `role` and `aria-selected` need to be there for accessibility reasons. If you don't set them, the component
  will continue working but it will not be accessible for user with disabilities.


  It is important to clarify that methods `_onSelect` and `_getSuggestionId` do not need to be implemented. They are
  part of the logic of `paper-autocomplete-suggestions`.

  When providing your own custom template, you might also need to provide your own custom search function. The reason
  for that is that the default search function only exposes text and value in the results. If each item in your data
  source contains more information, then you won't be able to access it. See the code of `<address-autocomplete>`
  element in the demo folder for a complete example.

  Another important thing to point out is related to the height of each suggestion item in the results. The height of
  the suggestion template changes dynamically depending on the height of a suggestion item. However, the following
  assumptions were made:
  - All suggestions items have the same height
  - The height of each item is fixed and can be determined at any time. For example, if you want to use images in the
  results, make sure they have a placeholder or a fixed height.


  ### Styling

  `<paper-autocomplete-suggestions>` provides the following custom properties and mixins
  for styling:

  Custom property | Description | Default
  ----------------|-------------|----------
  `--paper-item-min-height` | paper item min height | `36px`
  `--suggestions-wrapper` | mixin to apply to the suggestions container | `{}`
  `--suggestions-item` | mixin to apply to the suggestions items | `{}`

  ### Accessibility
  This component exposes certain necessary values in order to make your component accessible. When checking the ARIA
  specs, it is said that you need to inform users of the following changes:
  - Whether the popup with suggestions is open or not.
  - Id of the currently highlighted element

 You can access these values using the following properties: `isOpen` and `highlightedSuggestion`. The id of each
 element in highlightedSuggestion a random and unique id.

 In addition, as long as developers follow the general structure of each suggestion template, the following A11Y
 features are set in each suggestion:
 - `role="option"`
 - `aria-selected="true|false"`. This value will be false for all suggestion except in the one which is currently
 highlighted.

 By default, suggestions are only displayed after the user types, even if the current input should display them. If
  you want to show suggestions on focus (when available), you should add the property `show-results-on-focus`.
